>
> To resolve the conflict, we sat down and had a candid conversation about our different approaches and what was driving them. We were able to listen to ach other's perspectives and find a compromise that worked for both of us. We ended up completing the project on time and received positive feedback from the client.

However, after we began the migration process, we discovered that the chosen cloud provider did not have the necessary features and capabilities to support the client's workload.
>
>I realized that I had made an error in my initial assessment and had not taken into account all of the client's requirements. This caused delays and additional costs as we had to pivot to a different cloud provider and redesign the architecture.

>
>However, the vendor was delayed in providing us with the necessary information about the application's requirements and dependencies. We were under a tight deadline to get the application up and running, and we had to make a decision about how to proceed without having all of the necessary information.
>
>After considering our options, we decided to proceed with setting up a basic cloud infrastructure that would meet the minimum requirements of the application. We also put in place monitoring and alerting systems to help us quickly identify and resolve any issues that might arise once the application was deployed.
>
>This decision allowed us to meet the deadline and get the application up and running on schedule, even though we did not have all of the necessary information. However, it also required us to be proactive and proactive in addressing any issues that arose. In hindsight, it would have been better to have more information before making this decision, but given the circumstances, I believe it was the best course of action at the time.

**answer this cloud computing interview question: "tell me a time you received criticism"**
>One time I received criticism was when I was working on a project to migrate a client's on-premises data center to the cloud. The client was concerned about the security and privacy of their data, and I had recommended a particular cloud provider and architecture that I believed would meet their needs.
>
>However, after the migration was complete, the client raised concerns about the level of security provided by the chosen cloud provider. They pointed out that the provider had had a number of security breaches in the past, and they were worried about the potential for data breaches in the future.
>
>I realized that I had not done enough research into the security track record of the chosen cloud provider, and I had not adequately addressed the client's concerns. I apologized for the oversight and worked with the client to implement additional security measures to protect their data.
>
>This experience taught me the importance of thoroughly researching and evaluating the security and compliance capabilities of different cloud providers before making recommendations. It also reinforced the importance of listening to and addressing the concerns of clients, even when it requires additional work and effort.
