### Storytelling / Scenario-based Questions
------------
**answer this interview question: "tell me a time you had a conflict with a colleague"**

> One time that I had a conflict with a colleague was when we were working on a tight deadline for a client project. We had different approaches to tackling the project, and tensions started to rise as we got closer to the deadline.
>
> I was focused on breaking the project down into smaller tasks and delegating them to the team, while my colleague preferred a more hands-on approach and wanted to do everything themselves. This led to some misunderstandings and miscommunications, and we ended up working at cross purposes.
>
> To resolve the conflict, we sat down and had a candid conversation about our different approaches and what was driving them. We were able to listen to > each other's perspectives and find a compromise that worked for both of us. We ended up completing the project on time and received positive feedback from the client.
>
> Through this experience, I learned the importance of effective communication and finding a way to work through conflicts with colleagues. I now make a > point to have open and honest conversations with my team members when conflicts arise, and to find solutions that work for everyone.

**answer this interview question: "tell me a time you failed and what have you learnt from it"**

However, I didn't properly communicate my progress and dependencies to the rest of the team, >and as a result, the project ended up being delayed.
>
>From this experience, I learned the importance of clear communication and organization in teamwork. I realized that it's crucial to keep others informed >of my progress and to make sure that I'm properly coordinating with the rest of the team to ensure that everything is moving forward smoothly. I also >learned to be more proactive in seeking help or clarification when needed, rather than waiting for issues to arise.
>
>Overall, this failure taught me the value of effective communication and collaboration, and I made sure to apply these lessons to future projects.
